This gem leverages the Watir test framework to allow for easy modeling of specific web application information, 
allowing it to be decoupled from the tests.
The intention is to provide a solution that is easy to use and maintain, while still providing power and flexibility.

## Usage

Create a class that represents a unique page or modal on your site and have it inherit WatirDrops.

Please see [spec/support/test_page.rb](spec/support/test_page.rb) for an example.

Once you have created the representation of the page, your automated test can manipluate the page object.

Please see [spec/watir_drops_spec.rb](spec/watir_drops_spec.rb) for examples.

WatirDrops is written to accept several different ways to model test data. 

Please see [spec/form_filling_spec.rb](spec/form_filling_spec.rb) for examples.
